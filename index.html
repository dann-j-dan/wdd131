                    <p>My name is Lubangakene Daniel, and I proudly hail from Uganda—the Pearl of Africa. I currently reside in the vibrant and growing city of Lira, nestled in the heart of Northern Uganda. I come from a close-knit family of seven siblings, where laughter, shared responsibilities, and strong bonds shape our everyday life.

I am a passionate and curious individual withstrong affinity for technology and creativity. During my free time, I enjoy coding, building websites, and collaborating with friends on exciting online programming projects. My enthusiasm for innovation drives me to constantly explore new digital tools and sharpen my web development skills.

Beyond the screen, I am an avid football player who thrives on teamwork and strategy. I also find joy in video games, which not only entertain me but also challenge my problem-solving abilities. Music and dance are close to my heart—they allow me to express myself freely and energize my spirit.

Whether it’s through code, sport, rhythm, or relationships, I strive to live a life filled with purpose, growth, and connection.</p>
